# coding-challenge
Day 1:
In the Day 1 challenge, I performed the basic key observations from the dataset and documented them in a separate highlighted table placed to the right of the dataset.

Day 2:
In the Day 2 challenge, I completed the basic editing operations, including making the column headings bold, centering the numeric columns for better readability, inserting rows in the middle of the dataset, and adding a column at the right end of the dataset. The inserted rows and columns have been highlighted in yellow for easy reference.
